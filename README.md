# CvcStats
Collects lots of statistics from Cops and Crims games that normally aren't recorded, and provides a gui to compare stats for each map and game type (gui not yet implemented).

_Currently only for 1.8.9_

## Future Update Plans

1. Backend stuff
    * Fix bugs
    * Make code prettier and more efficient
      * Make an EventHandler class
      * Give some code their own methods
2. Add support for more events
    * TDM game ends with no team at 1000 points
    * Game ends with every opponent leaving (not sure whether this sends a different game end message)
    * Joining challenge mode games
      * Way to specify if the game is ranked, comp, a pvp, or for fun
3. Collect some more stats for fun
    * Times each nade is bought
    * Times F5'ed
